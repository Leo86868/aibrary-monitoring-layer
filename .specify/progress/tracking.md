## 💰 Budget Tracking

### Phase 1 Costs (Current)
| Service | Budget | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Apify TikTok | $10-20 | ~$5 | Active testing |
| Google Gemini | $1-5 | ~$0.50 | AI analysis |
| Lark Base | $0 | $0 | Free tier |
| **TOTAL** | **$11-25** | **~$5.50** | Well within budget |

### Projected Costs (Full System)
| Service | Budget | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Apify (3 strategies) | $30-50 | Trend discovery = higher volume |
| Google Gemini | $5-15 | AI analysis scaling |
| Lark Base | $0-12 | Team collaboration features |
| **TOTAL** | **$35-77** | Target: <$50/month |

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Resolved
- ✅ ~~Field name mismatch~~ → Fixed `video_downlaod_url` typo in Lark Base
- ✅ ~~URL field conversion errors~~ → Fixed empty URL handling
- ✅ ~~Wrong engagement metrics~~ → Fixed to use `diggCount`, `playCount`, `commentCount`
- ✅ ~~Actor re-running unnecessarily~~ → Implemented data reuse logic

### Current Issues
- 🔄 **AI analysis needs enhancement** → Working on competitor intelligence focus
- ⚠️ Data reuse time threshold too strict (1 hour) → Should extend to 24 hours
- ⚠️ No strategic classification yet → Part of current AI analysis work

### Future Considerations
- 📋 Team workflow features not yet implemented
- 📋 Multi-strategy target management pending
- 📋 Filter layers for inflow control planned
