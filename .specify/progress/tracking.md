## 🚧 In Progress

### Phase 3: n8n Workflow Implementation
- [ ] Build n8n workflow for Instagram monitoring
- [ ] Build n8n workflow for TikTok monitoring
- [ ] Implement 4-layer validation in n8n:
  - [ ] Layer 1: Engagement calculation
  - [ ] Layer 2: Keyword matching
  - [ ] Layer 3: Video transcription (conditional)
  - [ ] Layer 4: AI relevance scoring
- [ ] Connect to Lark (read targets, write results)

---

## 📅 Planned

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Test Instagram scraping with sample targets
- [ ] Test TikTok scraping with sample targets
- [ ] Validate cost per item is within budget
- [ ] Fine-tune quality thresholds
- [ ] Optimize keyword lists

### Phase 5: Production Deployment (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Schedule automated runs (daily/weekly)
- [ ] Monitor costs (Apify, OpenAI)
- [ ] Collect first batch of trending content
- [ ] Team training on Lark interface

### Phase 6: Future Enhancements
- [ ] Automated Lark/Slack notifications
- [ ] Trend visualization dashboard
- [ ] Historical performance tracking
- [ ] Reddit monitoring (optional)
- [ ] RSS feed monitoring (optional)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Current Goals
- ✅ Monthly budget: $50 max
- ✅ Cost-effective validation: <$5/month (vs. $200 with Perplexity)
- 🔄 Collect 800-1000 high-quality items/month
- 🔄 95%+ filter accuracy (no false negatives)
- 🔄 Team can add targets without technical knowledge

## 💰 Budget Tracking

### Estimated Monthly Costs
| Service | Budget | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Apify | $20-30 | TBD | Not started |
| OpenAI Whisper | $3-5 | TBD | Not started |
| OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | $0.10-1 | TBD | Not started |
| Lark | $0-12 | $0 | Free tier |
| **TOTAL** | **$23-48** | **$0** | Within budget |

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Resolved
- ✅ ~~Perplexity validation too expensive~~ → 4-layer system implemented
- ✅ ~~Airtable limitations~~ → Migrated to Lark
- ✅ ~~No security for credentials~~ → .gitignore + n8n credentials

### Open Issues
- ⚠️ n8n workflow not yet built (next step)
- ⚠️ TikTok integration pending (actor configured, needs workflow)
- ⚠️ No automated alerting yet
