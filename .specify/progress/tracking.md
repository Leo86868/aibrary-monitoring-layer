## 🐛 Known Issues

### Resolved
- ✅ ~~Field name mismatch~~ → Fixed `video_downlaod_url` typo in Lark Base
- ✅ ~~URL field conversion errors~~ → Fixed empty URL handling
- ✅ ~~Wrong engagement metrics~~ → Fixed to use `diggCount`, `playCount`, `commentCount`
- ✅ ~~Actor re-running unnecessarily~~ → Implemented data reuse logic

### Current Issues
- None! Phase 1 complete ✅

### Future Considerations
- 📋 Team workflow features not yet implemented
- 📋 Filter layers for inflow control planned
- 📋 Trend Discovery and Niche Deep-Dive analysis prompts (infrastructure ready)
