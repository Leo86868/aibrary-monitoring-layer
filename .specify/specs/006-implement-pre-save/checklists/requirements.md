# Specification Quality Checklist: Pre-Save Quality Filtering System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**:  PASSED - All validation checks complete

**Details**:
- All 4 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- 14 functional requirements defined with no ambiguity
- 8 measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- No implementation details in spec (no mention of Python, Lark API endpoints, data structures, etc.)

**Specification is ready for planning phase** (`/speckit.plan`)
