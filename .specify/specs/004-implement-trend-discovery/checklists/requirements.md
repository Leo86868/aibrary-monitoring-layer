# Specification Quality Checklist: Trend Discovery Monitoring Strategy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Spec avoids mentioning specific technologies (Apify/Gemini mentioned only in Dependencies/Constraints sections, which is appropriate)
- Focus is on viral content discovery, trend detection, and competitive insights
- Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- All 19 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (100+ items, 60 seconds, top 10%, 90% freshness)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (user-facing outcomes, not implementation details)
- 4 user stories with clear acceptance scenarios (16 total Given/When/Then scenarios)
- 7 edge cases identified with specific questions
- Scope is bounded (hashtags & search only, English only, no bot detection)
- Dependencies (Features 001-003) and assumptions (10 items) clearly documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories progress from core value (P1 hashtags) to enhancements (P3 analysis depth)
- Success criteria align with feature goals (scraping performance, filtering accuracy, analysis quality)
- No implementation leakage - technical notes are appropriately in Dependencies/Constraints sections

**Overall Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and testable. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
