# Feature Specification: Lark Base Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `000-lark-foundation`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft - Requires Discussion
**Input**: User description: "Establish Lark Base as core data hub for team collaboration, manual data entry, and multi-platform integration with scalable table relationships"

## Approved Architecture *(Based on Discussion)*

### Hybrid Table Strategy - Best of Both Worlds
**Adopted Approach** (inspired by modular architecture patterns):

```
Monitoring_Targets (unified, clustered by platform)
├── TikTok_Content (video-specific fields)
├── Instagram_Content (image/video fields)
├── RSS_Content (article/news fields)
├── LinkedIn_Content (professional network fields)
└── Platform_Configs (extensive configuration per platform)
```

**Key Principles from Article Analysis**:
- **Modular Architecture**: Each platform as configurable module
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Tables adapt to platform requirements
- **Centralized Configuration**: Platform configs in dedicated table
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Lightweight processing over heavy n8n workflows
- **Performance Focus**: Start simple (1 target), scale gradually

### Platform Diversity Handling
**Designed for Different Platform Requirements**:

- **RSS**: Simple URLs + article metadata
- **LinkedIn**: Professional network specific (job titles, companies, industries)
- **TikTok**: Video-centric (engagement, sounds, effects, transcription)
- **Instagram**: Image/video hybrid (stories, reels, posts, hashtags)

### Data Flow Architecture
**Event-Driven Processing Pattern**:
```
Team (10 people) → Monitoring_Targets → Platform Modules → Platform_Content → AI Processing Links
                                    ↘
                                   Platform_Configs (for complex setups)
```

**Future AI Integration**: Platform-specific tables designed with consistent IDs for linking to AI processing layers (podcast generation, trend analysis).

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Team Can Manage Monitoring Targets (Priority: P1)

Team members can add, edit, and manage monitoring targets across all platforms through Lark interface without technical knowledge.

**Why this priority**: Core foundation - everything depends on this working.

**Independent Test**: Team member adds TikTok profile "@openai", sets quality to "high", and sees it active in system within 5 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** team member opens Lark Base, **When** they add new monitoring target, **Then** all required fields are available and validated
2. **Given** monitoring target exists, **When** team member changes quality threshold, **Then** future processing uses new threshold
3. **Given** team wants to bulk import, **When** they upload CSV file, **Then** all targets are parsed and validated

### User Story 2 - Unified Content Database Access (Priority: P1)

All validated content from any platform appears in a single Content Database where team can review, annotate, and analyze results.

**Why this priority**: Central hub for all content intelligence - must work for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Content from TikTok module appears in database with all metadata, team can add notes and filter by platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** TikTok module processes content, **When** validation completes, **Then** content appears in unified database with platform identifier
2. **Given** content in database, **When** team member adds notes, **Then** annotations are saved and visible to all team members
3. **Given** multiple platforms active, **When** team filters by platform, **Then** only relevant content displays

---

### User Story 3 - Scalable Platform Integration (Priority: P2)

New platform modules can integrate with existing Lark tables without requiring schema changes or data migration.

**Why this priority**: Future-proofs the architecture for Instagram, Reddit, RSS additions.

**Independent Test**: Adding Instagram module requires only configuration changes, no table restructuring.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** TikTok module working, **When** Instagram module added, **Then** both use same target and content tables
2. **Given** platform-specific fields needed, **When** new module launches, **Then** flexible schema accommodates differences
3. **Given** team workflow established, **When** new platform added, **Then** no training required for team members

### Edge Cases

- What happens when team member enters invalid monitoring target?
- How to handle platform-specific fields that don't exist for other platforms?
- What if Lark API is down during content processing?
- How to manage duplicate content across platforms?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide unified Monitoring_Targets table supporting all platforms
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide unified Content_Database table with platform identifier
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate monitoring targets based on platform-specific rules
- **FR-004**: System MUST support manual data entry and editing through Lark interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle platform-specific metadata without breaking other platforms
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide team collaboration features (notes, flags, status)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support bulk import/export of monitoring targets
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain audit trail of changes and processing

### Key Entities *(Hybrid Architecture)*

**Monitoring_Targets Table** (Unified, Platform-Clustered):
- `target_id` (unique identifier)
- `platform` (tiktok, instagram, linkedin, rss)
- `target_type` (profile, hashtag, keyword, url, company)
- `target_value` (actual target: @username, #hashtag, company.com)
- `active` (boolean)
- `quality_preset` (low, medium, high)
- `config_link` (links to Platform_Configs for complex setups)
- `results_limit` (per processing run)
- `team_notes` (manual annotations)
- `created_by`, `created_date`, `last_modified`

**TikTok_Content Table** (Video-Specific):
- `content_id` (TikTok video ID)
- `target_id` (links to Monitoring_Targets)
- `video_url`, `author_username`, `caption`
- `likes`, `shares`, `comments`, `views`
- `video_duration`, `sounds_used`
- `hashtags`, `mentions`
- `transcription` (Whisper API result)
- `ai_relevance_score`, `keyword_matches`
- `team_flags`, `team_notes`
- `discovered_date`, `processed_date`

**Platform_Configs Table** (For Complex Platforms):
- `config_id`
- `platform`
- `config_name` (e.g., "LinkedIn Company Monitoring")
- `config_json` (extensive parameters)
- `created_by`, `active`

**Future Tables** (As Needed):
- `Instagram_Content`, `LinkedIn_Content`, `RSS_Content`
- `AI_Processing_Jobs` (links to platform content for podcast generation)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Team member can add monitoring target in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: All platform modules read/write to same tables without conflicts
- **SC-003**: Content from any platform appears in unified view within 2 minutes of processing
- **SC-004**: Team can manage 100+ monitoring targets without performance issues
- **SC-005**: Manual data entry has 100% reliability (no data loss)
- **SC-006**: Adding new platform requires zero table schema changes
- **SC-007**: Bulk import handles 50+ targets in under 1 minute

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
1. **Create Monitoring_Targets table** in Lark Base `Qr40bFHf8aKpBosZjXbcjF4rnXe`
2. **Create TikTok_Content table** (first platform)
3. **Create Platform_Configs table** (for future complex platforms)
4. **Test with 1 TikTok target** to validate architecture

### Phase 2: TikTok Integration
1. **Build lightweight TikTok processing module** (event-driven, not heavy n8n)
2. **Implement 4-layer validation pipeline**
3. **Test team workflow** with 10-person team input

### Phase 3: Scalability Testing
1. **Scale to multiple TikTok targets**
2. **Validate performance and cost metrics**
3. **Prepare architecture for next platform** (Instagram/LinkedIn/RSS)

### Alternative to Heavy n8n Workflows
Based on article insights, use **modular, event-driven processing**:
- Lightweight scripts with centralized configuration
- Platform-specific modules that adapt dynamically
- Performance-focused with lazy loading concepts

**Status**: Ready for implementation planning - specification approved based on discussion.
